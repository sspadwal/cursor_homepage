# Cursor Homepage Clone - HTML & CSS Project

Hey there! I worked on this project to recreate the Cursor website's homepage. I tried to make it look as close to the real thing as possible using only simple HTML and CSS. No fancy JavaScript or Tailwind was used here!

## � What I Recreated

I've built almost all the main parts of the home page:

1.  **Top Navbar**: Got the logo and the buttons exactly where they should be.
2.  **Hero Section**: That big heading and the product images overlapping—made it look just like the original.
3.  **Logos Section**: Added the group of company logos that trust Cursor.
4.  **Feature Blocks**: Three different sections showing what Cursor can do, with images and text swapping sides.
5.  **Capability Cards**: A nice grid of cards explaining the features.
6.  **Testimonials**: Quote cards from people like Andrej Karpathy and others.
7.  **Use Cases**: More cards with photos and quick info.
8.  **Changelog**: A list of the latest updates with dates.
9.  **Team Section**: The big group photo and the "Join Us" part.
10. **Final CTA**: One last big heading and download button at the bottom.
11. **Footer**: All the links and company info at the very end.

## 🎨 Design & Style

### The Fonts I Used

- **Main Font**: I used `CursorGothic` to keep it authentic. If the browser doesn't have it, it falls back to standard clean fonts like Helvetica or Arial.

### The Colors I Used

I kept the "Dark Mode" vibe very strict:

- **Background**: A very dark black/yellowish tint (`#14120b`).
- **Cards/Sections**: A slightly lighter dark shade (`#1d1b15`) to make them pop.
- **Main Text**: A soft white (`#edecec`) so it's easy on the eyes.
- **Accent Color**: That signature orange/red (`#f54e00`) for links and hover stuff.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- **Pure HTML**: Used semantic tags so the code is clean and easy to read.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Used Flexbox and Grid to get the layout perfect. No frameworks, just raw CSS.
